# Now imagine you have a certain data structure that

# the number of people who was registered with covid
# in a weekly basis.
# e.g. {'Spain': [4, 8, 2, 0, 1], 'France': [2, 3, 6],
#       'Italy': [6, 8, 1, 7]}
# Assuming that the moment they started reporting the
# number of registered cases is not the same (thus
# the length of the lists can differ)

# Create a function called "total_registered_cases_per_country"
# that has 1 parameter:
# 1) The data structure described above.

# The function should return a dictionary with a key

# registered so far that the country had
