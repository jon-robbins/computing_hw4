# Now imagine you have a certain data structure that
# contains information about different countries and
# the number of people who was registered with covid
# in a weekly basis.
# e.g. {'Spain': [4, 8, 2, 0, 1], 'France': [2, 3, 6],
#       'Italy': [6, 8, 1, 7]}
# Assuming that the moment they started reporting the
# number of registered cases is not the same (thus
# the length of the lists can differ)


# 7)
# Create a function called "total_registered_cases"
# that has 2 parameters:
# 1) The data structure described above.
# 2) A string with the country name.
#
# The function should return the total number of cases
# registered so far in that country


# 8)
# Create a function called "total_registered_cases_per_country"
# that has 1 parameter:
# 1) The data structure described above.
#
# The function should return a dictionary with a key
# per each country and as value the total number of cases
# registered so far that the country had
#


# 9)
# Create a function called "country_with_most_cases"
# that has 1 parameter:
# 1) The data structure described above
#
# The function should return the country with the
# greatest total amount of cases



###############
# Use the data in covid.csv for this exercise
#
# 10) In a separate file, write a piece of code that
# loads the covid.csv file and prints the list of countries
#  and the total average of death/confirmed among those countries
# for those countries that have more than 500, 1000 and 5000
# active cases respectively.
# Follow DRY principles in order to complete this exercise.
